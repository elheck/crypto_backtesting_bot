# crypto_bot

A first implementation of a crypto frequency trading bot.

* Currently only MACD as indicator and Backtesting as executor.
* This was used to test a specific indicator on historical data obtained through the binance public api.
* Saves historical data that it has obtained once as pickle and adds data to it if a larger timespan is needed.
